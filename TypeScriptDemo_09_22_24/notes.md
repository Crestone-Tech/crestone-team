# TypeScript

TypeScript is actually JavaScript wearing a Batman mask. It's just a superset of JavaScript, meaning that the underlying language doing the work is just JavaScript. TypeScript gets its name from the fact that it is a strictly *TYPED* language. Strictly typed languages simply involve defining the *type* of each variable, class, function, etc.. This differs from JavaScript in that JavaScript is *loosly typed*, and does not care what you say a variable is.
